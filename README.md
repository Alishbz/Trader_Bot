## **Core Concepts & Indicators**

### **1. Moving Average (MA)**  
The **Moving Average (MA)** calculates the average price movement of an asset over time. It helps traders smooth out price data and identify trends.  

#### **Types of Moving Averages:**

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):**  
  The arithmetic average of prices over a specific time period.  
  Example: A 50-day SMA would average the closing prices of an asset over the past 50 days.

- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**  
  EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more sensitive and faster to respond to price changes.  
  Example: The 12-period EMA gives more importance to the last 12 price points than to the earlier ones.

**Application in Trading:**  
Moving Averages can act as support and resistance levels. When the price is above a moving average, it may be seen as a support level, while if the price is below, it can be seen as a resistance level.  

#### **Crossover Strategies:**
- **Golden Cross:** When a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, it's a potential **buy signal**.  
  Example: A 50-day SMA crossing above a 200-day SMA.
  
- **Death Cross:** When a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, itâ€™s a potential **sell signal**.  
  Example: A 50-day SMA crossing below a 200-day SMA.

---

### **2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**  
MACD is a momentum and trend-following indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of an asset's price.  
- The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.  
- The signal line is the 9-period EMA of the MACD line.

**Trading Signals:**  
- **Bullish signal:** When the MACD crosses above the signal line.  
- **Bearish signal:** When the MACD crosses below the signal line.

---

### **3. Bollinger Bands**  
Bollinger Bands are volatility indicators that consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands that are standard deviations away from the middle band.  
- **Upper Band:** Represents overbought conditions.  
- **Lower Band:** Represents oversold conditions.

**Usage in Trading:**  
- Price bouncing off the lower band may indicate a **buy** signal, and bouncing off the upper band may indicate a **sell** signal.

---

### **4. Fibonacci Retracement**  
Fibonacci retracement is a tool used to identify potential levels of support and resistance. The key Fibonacci levels are **23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%**, and **100%**.

**Example:**  
- If the price rises from 100 to 200, traders may expect the price to retrace to levels such as 161.8% of the rise (161.8% of 100-200 move) before continuing the uptrend.

---

### **5. Stochastic Oscillator**  
The Stochastic Oscillator measures the level of the closing price relative to the high-low range over a specific period.  
- **Overbought zone:** Values above 80 indicate overbought conditions.  
- **Oversold zone:** Values below 20 indicate oversold conditions.

**Usage in Trading:**  
- A **buy signal** occurs when the oscillator crosses from below 20 to above 20.  
- A **sell signal** occurs when it crosses from above 80 to below 80.

---

### **6. Divergence**  
Divergence occurs when the price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of an indicator (such as MACD or RSI), potentially signaling a reversal.  

**Example:**  
- **Bullish Divergence:** When prices form lower lows, but the indicator forms higher lows, suggesting potential upward momentum.  
- **Bearish Divergence:** When prices form higher highs, but the indicator forms lower highs, suggesting potential downward momentum.

---

### **7. Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse)**  
The Parabolic SAR is a trend-following indicator that helps determine the potential reversal points in the market.  
- When the SAR is below the price, the trend is bullish, and when it is above the price, the trend is bearish.

---

### **8. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo**  
This is a Japanese technical analysis indicator that provides insights into the marketâ€™s trend, support and resistance levels, and potential future price movements. It consists of five lines:  
- **Tenkan-sen:** A fast-moving average.  
- **Kijun-sen:** A slower-moving average.  
- **Senkou Span A and B:** Leading lines forming the cloud, which indicates support or resistance.  
- **Chikou Span:** The lagging line, showing the current price in relation to the past.

---

### **9. ATR (Average True Range)**  
The ATR measures volatility by calculating the average of true ranges (the difference between the high and low of an asset for a period). A higher ATR indicates higher volatility.

---

### **10. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)**  
CMF is a volume-weighted average of accumulation and distribution over a specified period. It measures the money flow of an asset.  

**Interpretation:**  
- **Positive CMF:** Indicates accumulation (buying pressure).  
- **Negative CMF:** Indicates distribution (selling pressure).

---

### **11. On-Balance Volume (OBV)**  
OBV is a cumulative indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days, helping to gauge the direction of the trend.

---

### **12. Williams %R**  
Williams %R is a momentum indicator that measures overbought and oversold conditions.  
- **Overbought:** Values above -20.  
- **Oversold:** Values below -80.

---

### **13. Economic Indicators**  

- **CPI (Consumer Price Index):** Measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for goods and services.  
- **PPI (Producer Price Index):** Measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output.  
- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** Represents the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a specific time period.

### **14. Option Greeks**

- **BETA:** Measures an assetâ€™s sensitivity to market movements.  
- **Delta:** Measures the rate of change of an optionâ€™s price relative to the underlying assetâ€™s price.  
- **Gamma:** Measures the rate of change in delta.  
- **Vega:** Measures an option's sensitivity to volatility.  
- **Theta:** Measures the time decay of options.  
- **Rho:** Measures an option's sensitivity to interest rate changes.

### **15. Trading Concepts**  
- **Spread:** The difference between an assetâ€™s buying price and selling price.  
- **Margin:** The amount of capital required to open a position.  
- **Leverage:** Allows you to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital.  
- **Drawdown:** The decline from the highest value to the lowest during a particular period.
